# Statistic Learning Profile

## Overview
This repository serves as a simple knowledge hub for statistical learning, documenting my personal insights and understanding in this field. The primary focus is on linear regression analysis, which is a fundamental statistical method used to model the linear relationship between variables. This repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the concepts discussed. I'll keep working to complete this project.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the repository and provides a link to the `Linear_Regression_Analysis` directory.
- `main.tex`: the main latex template
- `structure.tex`: latex template for the structure of the document
- `Linear_Regression_Analysis`: This directory contains the core content of the repository, organized into individual lecture notes. Each lecture note is a `.tex` file that can be compiled into a PDF using a LaTeX editor. The `main.tex` file is the entry point for compiling the entire document.

## Reading Guide
To navigate through the repository, start with the `README.md` file for an overview. The `Linear_Regression_Analysis` directory contains the core content, organized into individual lecture notes. Each lecture note is a `.tex` file that can be compiled into a PDF using a LaTeX editor. The `main.tex` file is the entry point for compiling the entire document.
